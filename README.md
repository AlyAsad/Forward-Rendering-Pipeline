# Forward Rendering Pipeline

A fully functioning forward rendering pipeline coded in C++ that implements the modeling transformation, viewing transformation and rasterization stages. The program takes .xml scene files as input and produces a .ppm format rendered image of the scene.


## How to run

In the "code" folder, in a shell run:  `./rasterizer <𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡_𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒_𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒>.xml`
